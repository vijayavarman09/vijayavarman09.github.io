## Who am I?

I’m **Vijayavarman** – A hardworking **Cyber Detective**. By day, I’m a Cybersecurity grad student at RIT, learning the latest tricks to protect the virtual streets of the online world. By night, I’m lurking in the shadows, tracking down vulnerabilities, always ready to strike and patch up any weakness before it’s exploited.

I don’t wear a cape, but I do wear a lot of hats—**Threat Hunter, Incident Responder, and Cybersecurity Analyst**, always ready to defend the cyber landscape. I’m a problem solver at heart, and no puzzle is too complex when it comes to securing systems. Whether it's threat detection or risk management, I’m always one step ahead, ensuring that the bad guys don't get the upper hand.

My mission? To help secure the digital world, one system at a time, while keeping things interesting with creative solutions. When I’m not diving deep into security challenges, you’ll find me grabbing a bite, binge-watching the latest web series, or hitting the gym to keep my mind and body in shape.
